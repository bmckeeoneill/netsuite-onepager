My team and I have been actively reaching out because I've seen multiple customers in the manufacturing industry move to NetSuite recently. I want to ensure you see where it fits in your space before relying on patchwork tools or an ERP that won't keep up with new technology. I'd love to discuss your thoughts on this high-level whiteboard for process improvement and automations. I put together a simple whiteboard showing how process improvements and automation could look for your business. Take a look at this first pass and let me know a good time to walk through it together.
