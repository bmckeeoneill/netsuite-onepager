Hi Brian, I've noticed several companies in the manufacturing sector transitioning to NetSuite recently. It's crucial to see how it fits in your space before relying on patchwork tools or outdated ERP systems. I'd love to discuss how process improvements and automation could benefit Nakestores. I've prepared a simple whiteboard visual to illustrate potential enhancements. Let me know a good time to walk through it together. Best, [Your Name]
